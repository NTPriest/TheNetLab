# IPv4 Subnetting

Well, everybody knows that a real Network [insert any technical title here] has to know how to do subnetting and IP allocations.  

**Why?**  
Because IPv4 is an addressing system for communication between networks and hosts ‚Äî like a street name and number.  
We also have a subnet mask, which you can imagine as different neighborhoods that help packets find the right recipient.  

Without it, the city would be chaos.  
In networking terms, layer 4 simply wouldn‚Äôt exist ‚Äî the router wouldn‚Äôt know where to deliver packets to a specific network or device.  
Even worse, the whole TCP/IP and ISO/OSI models (the latter being more of a theoretical model) would get stuck at that layer.  
The only communication possible would be within a LAN, without any routing.  
Sounds kind of "disabled-friendly," doesn‚Äôt it?  

By 2025, IPv4 is pretty much exhausted, and corporations have slowly started migrating to IPv6 ‚Äî or at least using **Dual Stack** and **NAT64**.  
But for now, let‚Äôs focus on learning how to subnet IPv4.

---

## First of all ‚Äî in what format do we describe IPv4?

We describe IPv4 ‚Äî and every IP, really ‚Äî in **bits**.  
Bits are `1`s and `0`s ‚Äî in other terms, "yes" or "no/nothing."  
We use them because computers operate on bits.  
After that, we can convert them to decimal or hexadecimal, but at the lowest level, a PC always uses bits.

**Example:**

```192.168.1.0```

In binary it would be:
```11000000.10101000.00000001.00000000```
---

## Explanation

Each portion of 1s and 0s separated by a dot (`.`) is called an **octet**.  
Why "octet"? Because "octo" in Greek means *eight* ‚Äî which makes sense, since each octet contains eight bits (whether 1s or 0s).

Every bit represents a **value**:

```128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1```

Each of these values is a power of 2:
```
2^0 = 1
2^1 = 2
2^2 = 4
2^3 = 8
2^4 = 16
2^5 = 32
2^6 = 64
2^7 = 128
```

How do we know which bit is which?  
Because **x** in `2^x` is the bit position, starting from 0 (**righmost**) to 8 (**leftmost**).

So:

```
bit 8 = 128
bit 7 = 64
bit 6 = 32
bit 5 = 16
bit 4 = 8
bit 3 = 4
bit 2 = 2
bit 1 = 1
```

```

|  11000000 | 10101000 | 00000001 | 00000000 |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
|   192     |   168     |    1      |     0     |
-------------------------------------------------


```

## Putting it all together

We have **4 octets** (or **4 bytes**).  
`8 * 4 = 32` -> meaning all IPv4 addresses are **32 bits long**.  
That‚Äôs also why the **maximum prefix/mask value** is `/32` (we‚Äôll cover that later).

So:
192.168.1.0
is:
```11000000.10101000.00000001.00000000```


Now, sum up each octet according to the bits that are `1`:

- For the first octet (`11000000`):
128 + 64 = 192
- For the second (`10101000`):
128 + 32 + 8 = 168
- For the third (`00000001`):
1 = 1
- And the last (`00000000`):
0 = 0

So the full address is:
192.168.1.0

Now you know how to translate bits to decimal and vice versa.
Next, we‚Äôll learn how subnet masks work ‚Äî how to calculate them, find available hosts, and allocate networks using CIDR and VLSM.

# Subnet Mask
# Subnet Mask

A **subnet mask** is one of the most important parts of the subnetting process.  
It defines the **range of IP addresses** that belong to a given network.  

You can imagine it as a **local guide** in each neighborhood ‚Äî  
they know exactly which IPs (houses) are part of their area.  
But if that guide receives a request for an address that belongs to a different neighborhood,  
they‚Äôll have no idea where to go ‚Äî because that IP belongs to a different subnet.

In technical terms, the subnet mask separates the **network portion** from the **host portion** of an IP address.  
That‚Äôs how routers know whether a packet should stay inside the local network or be sent to another one.

How looks like subnet mask?
ex 255.255.255.0
Why is like that?
To understand this, remember: in a subnet mask, every bit set to `1` (shown as `255` in decimal)
marks the **network portion** of the address, while every bit set to `0` marks the **host portion**.

the converting works the same as previouse example: converting binary to decimal and vice versa
You can‚Äôt have something like this: `192.255.255.0` as a subnet mask ‚Äî  
the values in a mask must always decrease **from left to right** in a consistent binary pattern.  

For example, a mask like `168.192.255.0` doesn‚Äôt make sense ‚Äî  
because subnet masks must have all `1`s on the left and all `0`s on the right in their binary form.  

You can only use masks that follow valid binary boundaries, such as:
`255.255.255.0`, `255.255.255.128`, `255.255.255.192`, `255.255.255.224`, and so on.  

Invalid examples would be things like `255.255.255.64` or `255.255.192.64` ‚Äî  
because `64` (in binary `01000000`) breaks the rule of having continuous `1`s followed by continuous `0`s.

## Calculating the Network and Hosts with a Network ID

As you can see, subnetting isn‚Äôt that terrible after all.  
Now we just need to understand how to allocate **hosts** and define the **network itself** using a **Network ID**.  
I‚Äôm going to show you **two ways of calculating** ‚Äî a **slow** and a **fast** one (the second one is mine, and it‚Äôs especially useful for **LAN networks**).

---

### Key points to remember:

- The formula for calculating **usable hosts** is:  
2^n - 2

Where **`n`** is the number of bits remaining in the **host portion**.  
The **`-2`** accounts for the two reserved addresses:  
- one for the **network ID** (all host bits set to 0)  
- and one for the **broadcast address** (all host bits set to 1).  

So, ‚Äúusable hosts‚Äù are simply the addresses that can be **assigned to devices** within that subnet.

---

- The formula for calculating how many **subnets** can exist in a given network is:  
2^n

Where **`n`** is the number of bits borrowed from the host portion to create subnets.

---

### The ‚Äúslow‚Äù method:
The slow method requires operating directly on **binary values** to calculate:
- the **first host**,  
- the **last host**,  
- the **broadcast address**, and  
- the **network ID**.  

This approach is great for larger networks such as **WAN** or **MAN**, where precision matters and subnet design is more complex.

---

Now, before we go deeper into examples, we need to talk about another key concept ‚Äî  
the **IP address classes**.  
They are extremely important, and after that, we‚Äôll return to the previous topic.

---

# IP Address Classes

There are **five IP classes** in total, but only **three** of them are commonly used ‚Äî  
unless you‚Äôre a **network researcher** experimenting with special ranges.

---

## Class A
**Class A** is typically used for **WANs** ‚Äî *Wide Area Networks*.  
That means massive, public networks (think: ISPs, telecoms, or global enterprises).  

The **classfull** address range for Class A is:
`0.0.0.0 ‚Äì 126.0.0.0/8`


---

## Class B
**Class B** addresses are often used for **MANs** ‚Äî *Metropolitan Area Networks*.  
They‚Äôre common for **corporate**, **government**, or **infrastructure-level** networks ‚Äî something between a LAN and a WAN in scale.  

The **clasfull** range is:
`128.0.0.0 ‚Äì 191.255.255.255`

Class B networks are mid-sized ‚Äî big enough for organizations or campuses,  
but not as huge as global WANs.

---

## Class C
**Class C** is what we use in our **daily networking life** ‚Äî the **LAN** (*Local Area Network*).  
LANs are always **behind a firewall** and are **non-routable on the Internet**.  
In other words, LANs stay **inside** local networks only ‚Äî you can‚Äôt use a LAN IP to talk directly to another device on the public Internet.

The engineers from **IANA** realized early on that if everyone used only public IPs, the IPv4 address pool would be exhausted *fast as hell*.  
So they decided to reserve **private ranges** for local use.

On every LAN, many people can have the *same* local IPs ‚Äî because these addresses are reused across different networks behind NAT.

The private ranges for Class C (and other LAN scopes) are:
### classfull range:
`192.168.0.0 ‚Äì 223.255.255.255`

### reserved ranges:
- `192.168.0.0 ‚Äì 192.168.255.255
- 172.16.0.0 ‚Äì 172.31.255.255
- 10.0.0.0 ‚Äì 10.255.255.255`


You can read more about these ranges in **RFC 1918** ‚Äî  
an easy way to remember it: *World War I ended in 1918.*

https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1918

---

## Class D
**Class D** addresses are used for **multicast** traffic.  
Their range is:
`224.0.0.0 ‚Äì 239.255.255.255`

Multicast means sending one data stream to **multiple devices at once** ‚Äî  
instead of flooding everyone (like broadcast), it targets a **group of subscribed hosts**.

For example:  
- Streaming services  
- Routing protocols like **OSPF**, **EIGRP**, **RIP v2**  
- Real-time communication (VoIP, video)

---

## Class E
**Class E** is reserved for **experimental and research purposes**.  
Range:
240.0.0.0 ‚Äì 255.255.255.255
You‚Äôll almost never see these addresses in normal network configs ‚Äî  
they‚Äôre not routable on the public Internet and are generally reserved for testing.

## Loopback Address (127.0.0.1)

You might have noticed something ‚Äî there‚Äôs no **127.0.0.1** in the ranges we‚Äôve listed before.  
That‚Äôs because this range is **reserved** for **loopback** communication.

In simple terms ‚Äî it‚Äôs an IP that loops back to **your own device**.  
When you send a packet to 127.0.0.1, it never leaves your machine.  
The data goes straight through your **TCP/IP stack** and comes right back ‚Äî  
it‚Äôs like talking to yourself, but on a network level.

The entire **127.0.0.0/8** block (not just .1) is reserved for loopback,  
but we usually use `127.0.0.1` as the standard host address.

Common use cases:
- Hosting local web apps (`localhost`)
- Running development serv
- Testing sockets or TCP/IP stack behavior
- Diagnosing network issues ‚Äî try running:
```ping 127.0.0.1```

* üìù Small note:*  
If pinging the loopback address fails, your **TCP/IP stack** is broken ‚Äî not your NIC or router.

Loopback = an internal network inside your own OS.  
Nothing outside your device will ever see it.

* üìù Additional notes:*

The first things we can discuss again ‚Äî plus a few new ones ‚Äî are:

- **LAN IP addresses** are *not routable* on the public Internet.  
  They only work within your local network (behind NAT or a firewall).

- You **can‚Äôt assign a multicast address** directly to an end device.  
  Instead, devices or applications can **join multicast groups** dynamically using protocols like **IGMP** (in IPv4) or **MLD** (in IPv6).  
  This allows them to receive traffic sent to a specific multicast address,  
  but their actual interface IP remains a normal **unicast** address.

- **Public IPs** are used for **WAN (Wide Area Network)** connections ‚Äî  
  these are the addresses visible to the Internet.

- **Public IPs are usually dynamic.**  
  They change over time, or when you reboot or power off your modem/router.  
  Most home users get a dynamic public IP assigned by their ISP.

- You *can* obtain a **static public IP**, but it usually costs extra.  
  It‚Äôs mainly useful for hosting web services, game servers, or other externally accessible systems.  
  For normal users, it‚Äôs generally unnecessary ‚Äî unless you‚Äôre running something public-facing.

- You can only communicate **using your WAN-facing address** when reaching a different external network ‚Äî for example, when you ping a host on the Internet.  
It‚Äôs impossible to establish communication **from LAN to WAN** directly, unless you‚Äôre using **port forwarding** or **NAT translation** ‚Äî but that‚Äôs a more advanced topic, which I‚Äôll cover later in the ‚ÄúNAT Translating‚Äù section.

# BACKING UP!

So, we have our **LAN** IP and subnet network:  
```
IP: 192.168.1.0  
Mask: 255.255.255.0
```

Can we shorten this?  
Of course we can.

Instead of typing that long, worm-like decimal mask, we can just use **CIDR notation** ‚Äî for example:  
```
192.168.1.0/24
```

The `/24` is called a **prefix** in **CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing)** notation.  
It‚Äôs simply a *shortened subnet mask* ‚Äî easier to read and faster to type.

It means that the subnet mask contains **24 ones (`1`)** in its binary form, and the remaining bits are zeros (`0`):  
```
11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000
```

**Reminder:**  
- `1` ‚Üí network bits  
- `0` ‚Üí host bits  

---

### How many hosts and subnets can we assign to this network?

If you remember, the formulas are:
```
Usable hosts:  2^n - 2
Total subnets: 2^n
```

Here we can assign **254 usable hosts** (full range is 256 because `2^8 = 256`,  
but we always reserve two IPs ‚Äî one for **network ID** and one for **broadcast**).  

We have **8 free bits** (zeros in the mask), which represent host addresses.

Now, how many subnets do we have here?  
Well, it depends.  
You‚Äôve probably heard of **VLSM** and **CIDR**.

- **CIDR** ‚Üí that `/number` prefix; just a shorter representation of the subnet mask.  
- **VLSM** (Variable Length Subnet Mask) ‚Üí allows you to create *different-sized subnets* as needed ‚Äî very useful for optimizing address usage.

---

### üìù Note

Before **IANA** introduced CIDR and VLSM, the Internet used **classful addressing** ‚Äî meaning you couldn‚Äôt split networks freely.  
You had only the ranges defined by **Class A/B/C**, which was a massive waste of address space.

Later, **VLSM** was introduced to fix this problem ‚Äî it allows subdividing a single network into as many subnets as you want.  
Of course, each subnet is its **own isolated network**, with its **own broadcast** and **gateway IP**.

---

 *Pro tip:*  
Always think of subnetting like cutting a pizza. You decide how many slices you want ‚Äî just remember, each slice is a **separate network**, not just a smaller part of the same one.

## Playing with Bits ‚Äî Calculating Address Ranges, Slow method

There‚Äôs also a formula (or rather, a trick) that lets you **see directly from the bits** how many addresses are in a subnet.

Let‚Äôs take our network:
```
192.168.1.0  ‚Üí  Network ID / Scope
Mask: 255.255.255.0
```

In binary, the mask looks like this:
```
11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000
```

Now, let‚Äôs perform a **reverse (bitwise NOT)** operation ‚Äî meaning we flip every bit:  
replace `1`s with `0`s and `0`s with `1`s.

```
00000000.00000000.00000000.11111111
```

This binary pattern represents the **host portion**.  
If we add up the values of all the `1`s (128 + 64 + 32 + 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 + 1),  
we get **256** ‚Äî meaning this subnet can hold **256 total addresses**.

Of course, as you already know, we subtract 2 (one for **network ID**, one for **broadcast**) ‚Üí  
that gives **254 usable hosts**.

---

## Calculating the First and Last Hosts

The **first usable host** is always **+1** from the network ID.  
The **last usable host** is always **-1** from the broadcast address.

So, for our `/24` network:
```
Network ID:   192.168.1.0
First Host:   192.168.1.1
Last Host:    192.168.1.254
Broadcast:    192.168.1.255
```

That‚Äôs your complete **address scope** for a `/24` subnet.

---

*Tip:*  
If you want to do this mentally, remember:
- The number of host bits = number of zeros in mask  
- Hosts = 2^`n`  
- Usable = (2^`n`) - 2  
- Each increment in the last subnet octet = size of the subnet block

## Fast method
If you fell confidence enough Im going to give you fast way - my way BUT you have to remember a little from that chart:
Hosts/Subnets in network CIDR:
/24 H:**254** S:[**1**]
/25 H:**128** S:[**2**]
/26 H:**64**  S:[**4**]
/27 H:**32**  S:[**8**]
/28 H:**16**  S:[**16**]
/29 H:**8**   S:[**32**]
/30 H:**4**   S:[**64**] Router-to-router links
/31 H:**2**   S:[**128**] P2P links (RFC 3021)*
/32 H:**1**   S:[**254**] not usefull, loopback or static route
`/31` and `/32` are *special*: `/31` is used for point-to-point router links, `/32` for a single IP (loopback or static route).

As you can see, the numbers rise and fall in a proportional pattern as the subnet size changes.
When the number of hosts goes down, the number of subnets goes up ‚Äî pretty neat, isn‚Äôt it?
I sometimes even count it on my fingers ‚Äî like, the fourth finger is /24, the fifth is /25, and so on.

## Real Calculation Example

we have network `192.168.2.29` and our boss wants **4 subnets** from this.  
why those non-zero hosts at the end?  
because many tutorials and tech people like to overcomplicate things ‚Äî  
but calm down, it's **easy as hell**.

let's remind our **CIDR chart** again.  
we know:
- we want **4 subnets**
- that means `/26` prefix
- `/26` = **64 hosts** (62 usable)

our given address `192.168.2.29` already sits *inside* one of those subnets,  
so we **don‚Äôt** start counting from `.29` ‚Äî it‚Äôs not a network boundary.

instead, find the **valid block start** ‚Äî that means we check the subnet step size.  
for `/26`, the block size is **64** in the last octet.

so subnet ranges go like this:

192.168.2.0 - 192.168.2.63
192.168.2.64 - 192.168.2.127
192.168.2.128 - 192.168.2.191
192.168.2.192 - 192.168.2.255


so `192.168.2.29` falls inside the first subnet (0‚Äì63 range).  
that means:
- **Network ID:** `192.168.2.0`  
- **First usable:** `192.168.2.1` ‚Äî just add +1, that‚Äôs your first host  
- **Last usable:** `192.168.2.62` ‚Äî (total hosts - 2 = 62 usable)  
- **Broadcast:** `192.168.2.63` ‚Äî (last address in the range)

### why 62 and not 63 for the last host?

because we always reserve **2 addresses** in every subnet:  
one for the **network ID** (the very first, `.0`)  
and one for the **broadcast** (the very last, `.63` here).  

so when you see the formula `2^n - 2`,  
that ‚Äú-2‚Äù literally means: *subtract network and broadcast addresses.*  

-> that‚Äôs why your last usable is **62**, not 63.  
easy, right?

### Next Example

we have `192.168.1.36` and we want to divide that network into `/27`.

Here we go again...  
as you remember ‚Äî if the **host number** (from our CIDR chart) doesn‚Äôt fit nicely into the current host bits,  
you just **round it down to the nearest valid subnet boundary** ‚Äî basically, zero out the host bits.

now, if the number *does* fit, you just calculate the **nearest subnet range** it belongs to.

**Simple rule:**  
Find where your IP ‚Äúlands‚Äù ‚Äî in which block of subnets (0‚Äì31, 32‚Äì63, 64‚Äì95, etc.),  
then assign the correct **Network ID**, **First usable**, **Last usable**, and **Broadcast** addresses.

**Example:**
- **Network ID:** 192.168.2.32  
- **First usable:** 192.168.2.33 ‚Äî add +1, that‚Äôs your first host  
- **Last usable:** 192.168.2.62 ‚Äî total hosts - 2  
- **Broadcast:** 192.168.2.63 ‚Äî last address in the range

**Breakdown:**  
- **Network ID:** 192.168.1.32  
- **Subnet size:** 32 addresses  
- **Next subnet** starts at: 32 + 32 = 64 ‚Üí 192.168.1.64  
- **Last usable host:** 32 + 32 - 2 = 62 ‚Üí 192.168.1.62  
- **Broadcast:** 192.168.1.63  

**Key point:**  
You‚Äôre adding the subnet size to the **Network ID**, not the first host.  
That‚Äôs why the last host is always `(Network ID + Subnet size - 2)`.

## Summary (LAN calculation)

Very well, now you know how to subnetting internetwork by yourself, if you have trouble with that don't worry just review material again - and practice

## Calculating address with Class B

As we know subnetting LAN is easy, but we going to do something more complex, subnetting within Class B
We have to take different approach to calculate those networks - or use ip calculate.

Example:
- 16.103.217.41/19

**If you don‚Äôt know the CIDR chart and the 7 common masks:**

`if you dont know CIDR chart and 7 masks`:
**1.** Identify which block the IP belongs to:
- The IP is `16.103.217.41`.  
- Focus on the **third octet** (`217`) because /19 means the first **19 bits are network**, so the split happens in the third octet.

**2.** Subnet mask for /19:
- Binary: `255.255.224.0`  
- Host portion (**bitwise NOT**): `0.0.31*.255`  
  -> tells us the **block size is 32 addresses in the third octet**,  
     and **always round up to match the CIDR block size** (hosts).  

**3.** Calculate which /19 block contains 217:
- Blocks in the third octet (step = 32):  
  0, 32, 64, 96, 128, 160, 192, 224  
- `217` falls into the block starting at **192**.  
- So the **Network ID** = `16.103.192.0`.

**4.** Calculate hosts and broadcast:
- **First Host:** `16.103.192.1`  
- **Last Host:** `16.103.223.254` (Network ID + block size - 2)  
- **Broadcast:** `16.103.223.255`  

**5**Next Subnet:
- **Next Network ID:** `16.103.224.0` (add block size = 32 to third octet start)  

**Summary:**
- **Network ID:** 16.103.192.0  
- **First Host:** 16.103.192.1  
- **Last Host:** 16.103.223.254  
- **Broadcast:** 16.103.223.255  
- **Next Subnet:** 16.103.224.0

**If you already know the CIDR mask (or the ‚Äú7 common masks‚Äù), you can skip the block calculations and just match the IP to the correct subnet directly.**

**Common masks (usable hosts, -2):**
- /25 -> 128 -> H: [126]
- /26 -> 192 -> H: [62]
- /27 -> 224 -> H: [30]
- /28 -> 240 -> H: [14]
- /29 -> 248 -> H: [6]
- /30 -> 252 -> H: [2]
- /31 -> 254 -> H: [1]
I typed useable hosts (-2)

Congrats you know how subnetting LAN, and more than that.
